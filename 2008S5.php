                  <strong>Monitoring of Disease Activity and Gene Therapy for Dysferlin Deficiency</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>

<br>


We are developing two different strains of mice that will allow non-invasive and serum monitoring of disease activity for muscular dystrophies.  In order to follow the degeneration of myofibers, we are engineering a strain that will have an inducible reporter gene that will be expressed only in mature muscle fibers that are present at the time of induction.  This will be accomplished by crossing a strain of mice that expresses the Cre-ER construct under the control of the MRF4 promoter with a strain that expresses a luciferase and secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter construct in the Rosa locus.  When this double-transgenic strain is crossed to a dysferlin-deficient strain and progeny of the appropriate genotype are identified, we will be able to follow the time course of decline of luciferase expression, non-invasively, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels, both of which will reflect the time course of fiber degeneration.  The other strain will instead have Cre-ER expression under the control of the Pax7 promoter.  Therefore, the increase in signals for luciferase and serum AP will mirror the regenerative activity of the disease.  Together, these models should allow for detailed characterization of natural history of disease activity as well as responses to therapy. 
We are also pursuing a gene correction approach to point mutations in the dysferlin gene.  We have developed single-stranded oligonucleotides that are designed to pair with and induce alteration of a single base of the mutant dysferlin gene in muscle cells of the SJL mice in order to restore normal splicing, and thus normal dysferlin protein production.  We are currently testing these oligonucleotides in isolated myoblast cultures from the mice, and testing for gene correction at the genomic level.

                  <strong>Current Issues and Perspectives in Imaging Technologies for Dysferlinopathy: From Fundamental Study to the Monitoring of a Treatment</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>

<br>


Different imaging technologies have been used for the study of dysferlinopathy, but fluorescence microscopy combined with pulsed laser has probably had the biggest impact on fundamental study with the demonstration that the pathology is related to a deficiency in membrane repair.  Confocal microscopy can also be used for  3 dimensional high resolution images of muscle in live mice.  A few examples that have been obtained in Genethon will be shown.  The potentials and examples of the FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) and FRET (Forster Resonance Energy Transfer) technologies for the understanding of specific molecular mechanism will be presented.  Photonic imaging is well suited for microscopy and fundamental studies but has limited tissue penetration power and few medical applications exist. The second part of the presentation will therefore be based on real non invasive in vivo imaging for small animals derived from medical imaging.  The advantages and limitations of technologies like X-Ray, MRI and gamma-scintigraphy will be discussed.  In addition, our project “Technimaging” as well as preliminary data, will be presented.  The approach is based on scintigraphic quantification of technetium-labelled albumin uptake in damaged muscle fibers in live mice. The commonly used blue-evans fluorophore for evaluating the muscle fiber permeability has inspired this approach.  We hope to develop a rapid and reproducible non-invasive method for the quantification of muscle integrity in dysferlin deficient mice that should be easily transposable to clinical applications.  A short presentation of a quantitative analysis of CT-scan that has been recently studied for the natural history of a limb girdle muscular dystrophy will also be presented in order to discuss the potential of the multimodal-imaging techniques associating CT-Scan and scintigraphy for the precise evaluation of the effect of a treatment for dysferlinopathy.

                  <strong>Attempts to Optimize Methods for Study of Muscle-Gene Mutations in Tissue Culture</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>

<br>


There are several general problems with the use of tissue culture for the study of genetic defects in myogenic cells. 
First, there is uncertainty as to the relationship between the behaviour of cells in tissue culture and their behaviour in vivo.  We propose that the best approach to this problem is the use of freshly isolated muscle fibers.  In such preparations, satellite cells represent the myogenic resources of the tissue sample and behave in a manner very similar to that of satellite cells in the body.
Second, it is difficult to routinely establish standard conditions in primary cultures from which to make comparisons of behaviour and function of myogenic cells.  In addition to the use of freshly isolated fibres described above, it is possible to generate conditionally immortal myogenic cell lines by crossing mice carrying a desired mutation with the immortomouse.  Myoblasts derived in this way can be perpetuated as clones and maintain good genetic and phenotypic stability over long periods.  Moreover, on cessation of ‘permissive’ conditions, the cells synchronously and uniformly differentiate into myotubes.  This permits their use in routine screening assays.
Third, in cell cultures established from pathological muscle samples, it is difficult to differentiate between effects that are directly attributable to the endogenous genetic defect and those that are secondary to the pathological disturbance of the environment from which they have been derived.  This again can be allowed for, in part at least, by the comparative study of immortomouse cell lines obtained from mice at different stages in the course of the disease.
Each of these issues will be illustrated by example and discussed. </p>

                  <strong>Generation and Characterization of Dysferlin-Deficient C2C12 Cell Lines</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>

Maxwell M, Newton K, Reshev D, Glover L, Brown RH Jr.<br><br>

Studies of normal and dystrophic muscle are facilitated by the availability of myogenic cell lines with specific genotypes.  To facilitate studies of dysferlinopathies, we have used RNAi techniques to generate myogenic C2C12 lines that are dysferlin-deficient.  For this purpose, we first generated dysferlin-targeting shRNA vectors, using sequences corresponding to mouse dysferlin, beginning with the mouse dysferlin shRNA target set from Sigma.  Oligos encoding five different shRNAs and one non-targeting shRNA were cloned into the pSiren vector (an oncoretroviral  RNAi vector that permits expression of the hairpin RNA and has a puromycin-selectable marker, from Clontech).  We then tested the efficacy of the five dysferlin shRNAs by transfection of plasmid DNA into C2C12 mouse myoblasts.  Four shRNAs yielded >80% knockdown of dysferlin in C2C12 myotubes.  We then packaged these plasmids into transduction-competent ecotropic retrovirus and transducted C2C12 cells, which were subsequently cloned in puromycin.  Puromycin-selected myoblasts were fused into myotubes and analyzed for expression of dysferlin and desmin.  Using limiting dilution, multiple single-cell clones were obtained from pools expressing distinct anti-dysferlin shRNAs.  Clones were then analyzed for fusion capacity and for dysferlin and desmin expression.  In subsequent studies, we have characterized and compared the properties of dysferlin-deficient and dysferlin-positive C2C12 lines, with respect to growth properties, fusion indices, membrane repair, and profiles of mRNA and microRNA expression.</p>
