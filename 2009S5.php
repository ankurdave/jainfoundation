Human myoblast cell lines derived from pathological biopsies represent precious tools to assess pathophysiology and to test different therapeutic strategies in vitro. However, until recently, the only human myoblast cell lines available were derived from rhabdomyosarcomas, and had lost most of their differentiation potential. Unlike murine cells, the proliferation of human myoblasts is strictly limited by telomere shortening. However, thetransduction of telomerase, an enzyme capable of elongating telomeres, is not sufficient to immortalize human myoblasts. Recently, we have shown that, in addition to telomere shortening, a stress pathway is triggered in vitro in these cells, leading to the accumulation of the protein p16 that blocks the cell cycle. Whether this pathway is also triggered in vivo in pathologies is still unknown. Overexpression of cdk-4 can trap p16 and inhibit the cell cycle arrest due to the stress pathway. In this context, we have transduced human
myoblasts with both telomerase (hTERT) and cdk-4, using retroviral transduction, and have described the isolation of the first immortal cell line derived from a biopsy from a control adult subject. These immortalized myoblasts grow indefinitely, and can differentiate as well as normal myoblasts upon serum removal. They are not tumorigenic, and have been injected into regenerating muscles of immunodeficient mice. They participate in the host’s muscle regeneration and are even more efficient in this process than myoblasts isolated from a newborn control subject. We are now in the process of creating several human cell lines derived from myoblasts isolated from dysferlin deficient patients. We aim at creating cell lines harbouring some of the major mutations in the dysferlin gene that can be targeted by therapeutic approaches, and these tools will be available to assess these strategies.

                  <strong>Use of Thymidine Analogues to Study Loss and Regeneration of Muscle Fibers in
Mouse Models of Myopathies</strong><br>

<br>


Mouse models of human myopathies are much used to study the course of the diseases, to identify potential therapeutic targets and to conduct preliminary therapeutic tests, but there is a lack quantitative measures of muscle loss or regeneration. We are developing such methods on the mdx mouse with the intention of applying them to dysferlinopathies and other myopathic conditions. It involves labeling muscle fiber nuclei with synthetic thymidine analogues, Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU), which are incorporated into a cell’s DNA when the cell is dividing, and following the fate of this labeled cohort of muscle nuclei. Label applied throughout the first postnatal week enters many labeled myogenic cells that fuse into the growing muscle fibers where they remain until the fibers die. During further growth BrdU-labeled myonuclei become diluted by fresh input from nonlabeled myogenic cells. In mdx mice, this dilution is enhanced by necrotic loss of muscle fibers containing labeled myonuclei accompanied by repair by unlabeled myoblasts. This excess drop in the proportion of BrdU-labeled myonuclei in mdx mice provides an index of loss of muscle nuclei due to the loss of muscle. In preliminary experiments the frequency of BrdU labeling is indistinguishable between mdx and wild-type mice up to 16 days of age. In the mdx it declines rapidly beyond the age of 20-21 days when the myopathy begins and is almost totally lost by 50 days of age. Stereological analysis of this system will permit estimates of the absolute numbers of labeled and unlabeled myonuclei per anatomical muscle at intervals throughout the course of the disease, permitting sensitive detection of the effects of any given intervention on the survival and/or regeneration of muscle. This approach will be applied to dysferlin-deficient strains of mouse. The paucity of information on the time-course of the myopathy in these models requires that we initially space sampling of labeled mice over a period of 1 year, intercalating more frequent samples into the protocol as we progressively gather information on the time of onset and the period of maximum pathological change.

                  <strong>Therapeutic Approaches and Disease Monitoring for Dysferlin Deficiency</strong><br>

Katie Maguire, Leland Lim, Pinky Tripathi, Thomas A. Rando<br><br>


We are developing two different strains of mice that will allow non-invasive and serum monitoring of disease activity for muscular dystrophies. We refer to these as the “Regeneration Monitor” (RM) and the “Degeneration Monitor” (DM) strains. We are further along in developing the RM strain, in which an inducible Cre (Cre-ER) is expressed under the control of the Pax7 promoter in mice that have luciferase (LUC) and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter genes knocked into the Rosa locus. The administration of Tamoxifen to these mice results in LUC and SEAP expression, permanently, in satellite cells. The lineage of these cells can then be followed and we have preliminary data during normal growth. We are now crossing this strain with a dysferlin deficient strain. Upon administration of Tamoxifen to the progeny of those breedings, we will be able to follow overall satellite cell activity (as a read-out of the regenerative response) non-invasively during disease progression. The DM strain is similar except that Cre-ER is expressed under the control of the MRF4 promoter. Administration of Tamoxifen to these mice results in reporter gene expression only in differentiated fibers, so the loss of signal over time in the dysferlin-deficient strain will be used as a read-out of fiber degeneration associated with disease activity. We have continued our studies of oligonucleotide-mediated gene repair for dysferlin deficiency due to point mutations. These have been hampered in our studies in the SJL mouse because of the high level of normal dysferlin transcript and protein in the muscles and muscle cells of those mice. We have been developing quantitative methods to assess small changes in transcript levels to be able to measure oligonucleotide-mediated gene correction on top of the background levels. Finally, in collaboration with Michele Calos’ laboratory, we have begun isolating, characterizing, and expanding in culture mesoangioblasts from dysferlin-deficient mice. Our strategy is to employ gene therapy strategies for ex vivo gene therapy followed by systemic cell transplantation as an approach for treatment of dysferlin deficiency. We have successfully isolated and cultured mesoangioblasts from adult mice and current studies are focused on gene correction and cell transplantation.</p>
