What is AHNAK?</strong>					  <p>Also called Desmoyokin, AHNAK is very large  (700kd) protein that is ubiquitously expressed in many cell types. In  epithelial cells, it is localized to the plasma membrane, whereas in  non-epithelial cells, it is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It shuttles  between nucleus and cytoplasm depending on the extracellular Ca++  concentration. It has been shown to interact with Annexin 2/S100A10 complex and  regulate Actin cytoskeleton organization and cell membrane architecture. No <em>in vivo</em> functions are known for AHNAK.					  <br><em>Amagai, Journal of Investigative Dermatology 123 (4): xiv-xv. A Mystery of AHNAK/Desmoyokin Still Goes On</em></br></p>					  <strong>2. How was the interaction between AHNAK and Dysferlin demonstrated?</strong>					  <p>Carboxy-terminal domains of both AHNAK proteins  (AHNAK1 and 2) interact directly with C2A-Dysferlin. The N-terminal portion of 			                         Myoferlin  also interacts with the C-terminus of both AHNAK proteins.					  <em><br>Huang et al., FASEB J 21 (3): 732-742</em> 				      <p><strong>3. Have knock-out mice been generated for AHNAK? If yes, what is their phenotype?</strong></p>					  <p>ANAK knock-out mice have no developmental irregularities and do not exhibit any abnormal phenotype. Upon further investigation, it 			                         was uncovered that another related protein exists, AHNAK2, which probably compensates for the loss of AHNAK/Desmoyokin.					  					  <em><br>Komuro et al., PNAS 101 (12): 4053-4058</em>					  <em><br>Kouno et al., J Invest Dermatol. 123 (4): 700-707</em></p>					  <p><strong>4. Are there any naturally occurring AHNAK mutations and/or deficiencies know to be associated with human disorders?					  </strong></p>                      <p>No human disorders have been attributed to AHNAK deficiency as of yet.</p>					  <p><strong>5.	How are the levels of AHNAK secondarily affected in case of Dysferlin-deficiency?</strong></p>					  Secondary reduction of AHNAK was reported in muscle tissue from LGMD2B patients, though it persisted in blood-vessels. 					  <br><em>Huang et al., FASEB J 21 (3): 732-742</em></br>                  </p></td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td>&nbsp;</td>              </tr>            </table></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td bgcolor="#FDFFC6" align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>            <td bgcolor="ffffff">&nbsp;</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td height="30" align="right" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"></td>            <td height="30" align="right" valign="middle" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"><p class="footer">                <? include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>              </p>            </td>          </tr>        </table></td>        <td background="../images/bg_dot.gif" width="1"></td>      </tr>    </table>    <table width="780" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td height="4" background="../images/bg_green.gif"></td>      </tr>    </table>		</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
