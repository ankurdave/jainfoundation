What are Annexins?</strong>					  <p>Annexins are Ca++ dependant phospholipids-binding proteins. Annexins form a multi-membered superfamily whose constituents are generally cytosolic, and are implicated in functions such as membrane organization, exocytosis, endocytosis, ion fluxes, signal transduction etc.					  <br><em>Moss and Morgan, Genome Biology 5:219</em></br>					  <br><em>Gerke and Moss, Physiol Rev 82: 331-371</em></br></p>					  Annexin A1 (Annexin 1 or Lipocortin) has been implicated in the regulation of phagocytosis, cell signaling, proliferation, inflammation and control of anterior pituitary hormone release. A requirement for Annexin A1 in Ca++ induced plasma membrane repair has also been described.					  <br><em>McNeil et al., JBC 281 (46): 35202-35207</em></br>					  <p>Annexin A2 (Annexin II or Calpactin) plays a role in functions such as vesicle trafficking, osteoclast formation and bone resorption, and anticoagulant reactions.</p>					  					  <p><strong>2. How was the interaction between Annexin A1 and A2, and Dysferlin demonstrated?</strong></p>					  <p>Dysferlin was shown to interact with Annexins A1 and A2 in a Ca++ and membrane-injury dependant fashion. The interaction was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation.					  <em><br>Lennon et al., JBC 278 (50): 50466-50473</em> 					  				      <p><strong>3. Have knock-out mice been generated for Annexin A1 and A2? If yes, what is their phenotype?</strong></p>					  <p>Yes, mouse knockout models have been generated for both Annexin A1 and A2. </p>					  Annexin A1 knockout mice exhibit resistance to anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids and an exacerbated response to certain stimuli-induced inflammation. Macrophages from these mice have aberrant phagocytosis.					  <br><em>Hannon et al., FASEB 17: 253-255</em></br>					  <p>Annexin A2 mice are developmentally normal but show microvascular fibrin accumulation, impaired clearance of injury-induced arterial thrombi and impairment of postnatal angiogenesis.					  <br><em>Ling et al., Journal of Clinical Investigation 113 (1): 38-48</em></br></p>					  <p><strong>4. Are there any naturally occurring Annexin A1 and A2 mutations and/or deficiencies know to be associated with human disorders?					  </strong></p>                      <p>No human disorders have been attributed to Annexin A1 or A2 deficiency as of yet.</p>					  <p><strong>5.	How are the levels of Annexin A1 and A2 secondarily affected in case of Dysferlin-deficiency?</strong></p>					  Microarray analysis of eight dysferlinopathy patients (7-Miyoshi, 1-LGMD phenotype) showed upregulation of Annexin A2. 					  <br><em>Campanaro et al., Human Molecular Genetics 11: 3283-3298</em></br>					  <p>A positive correlation has been also been observed between disease severity and levels of Annexin A1 and A2 from dysferlinopathic patients (as well as those suffering from other muscular disorders).					  <br><em>Cagliani et al., Human Mutation 26 (3): 283</em></br></p>					  <p>Localization of both the Annexins at the sarcolemma is disrupted in dysferlinopathic muscle sections.					  <br>					  <em>Lennon et al., JBC 278 (50): 50466-50473</em></p>                  </p></td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td>&nbsp;</td>              </tr>            </table></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td bgcolor="#FDFFC6" align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>            <td bgcolor="ffffff">&nbsp;</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td height="30" align="right" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"></td>            <td height="30" align="right" valign="middle" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"><p class="footer">                <? include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>              </p>            </td>          </tr>        </table></td>        <td background="../images/bg_dot.gif" width="1"></td>      </tr>    </table>    <table width="780" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td height="4" background="../images/bg_green.gif"></td>      </tr>    </table>		</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
