What is known about the developmental expression pattern of Dysferlin?</strong>					  <p align="justify">The earliest presence of Dysferlin protein in  human fetal muscle tissue can be detected at embryonic weeks 5-6, a stage when  limbs begin to show regional differentiation (<em>Anderson et al., Human Molecular Genetics 8 (5): 855-861</em>). Dysferlin  shows differential expression and subcellular distribution during early  myogenesis. Data from primary human muscle cultures indicates that the level of <em>dysferlin</em> RNA progressively increases  as myoblasts differentiate into myotubes (<em>deLuna  et al., J of Neuropath Exp Neuro 63 (10): 1104-1113</em>). Consistent with this  transcriptional pattern, C2C12 cultures show that Dysferlin protein expression begins  at later stages of myoblast fusion. Also, in contrast to mature muscle fibres,  Dysferlin shows a cytoplasmic distribution in myotubes (see question 3 below; <em>Klinge et al., FASEB J 21: 1768-1776</em>).</p>					  					  <strong>2. Which cell types express Dysferlin?</strong>					  <p align="justify">The highest expression of Dysferlin protein is  found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and kidneys. Dysferlin expression has also  been reported in satellite cells (SCs) and certain immune cells like monocytes and  macrophages. &nbsp;In addition, a shorter  transcript of 4kb is detectable in the brain tissue and faint, lower molecular  weight bands can be detected in the brain stem, spinal cord and sciatic nerve (<em>Glover and Brown, Traffic 8: 785-794; deLuna  et al., J of Neuropath Exp Neuro 63 (10): 1104-1113; Anderson et al., Human  Molecular Genetics 8 (5): 855-861</em>)<em>. </em>Recently  Dysferlin expression was also detected in human placental microvillus  syncytiotrophoblasts (<em>Vandre et al., Biol  Reprod 77: 533-542</em>)<em>. </em>Dysferlin  positive staining is also observed in case of stomach, lung, liver and spleen  tissue from rats (<em>Anderson et al., Human  Molecular Genetics 8 (5): 855-861</em>).					  <p><strong>3. Where is Dysferlin localized in the cell?</strong></p>					  <p align="justify">Dysferlin is predominantly localized at the  sarcolemma of skeletal muscle cells and can be clearly visualized at the cell periphery  by immunostaining of normal muscle. This surface localization is absent or  markedly reduced in patients suffering from MM/LGMD2B(<em>Anderson et al., Human  Molecular Genetics 8 (5): 855-861; Glover and Brown, Traffic 8: 785-794;  Piccolo et al., Ann Neurol 48: 902-912</em>)<em>. </em>Dysferlin also shows cytoplasmic presence, and associates with the T-tubule  network (<em>Ampong et al., Acta Myologica  24: 134-144; Klinge et al., FASEB J 21: 1768-1776</em>). In fact, Dysferlin  localization in C2C12 myotubes is largely intracellular, and gives a reticular  staining pattern. It is widely believed that cytoplasmic vesicles also harbor  Dysferlin, though a direct localization to the vesicular compartment has not  been demonstrated yet (<em>Piccolo et al.,  Ann Neurol 48: 902-912; Bansal et al., Nature 423: 168-172</em>).</p>			    </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td>&nbsp;</td>              </tr>            </table></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td bgcolor="#FDFFC6" align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>            <td bgcolor="ffffff">&nbsp;</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td height="30" align="right" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"></td>            <td height="30" align="right" valign="middle" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"><p class="footer">                <? include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>              </p>            </td>          </tr>        </table></td>        <td background="../images/bg_dot.gif" width="1"></td>      </tr>    </table>    <table width="780" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td height="4" background="../images/bg_green.gif"></td>      </tr>    </table>		</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
