What is Caveolin-3?</strong>					  <p>Caveolae are small membrane invaginations on the surface of cells that participate in membrane-trafficking, sorting, transport and                         signal transduction. Caveolins play a role in the formation of caveolar membranes. Caveolin-3 or M-Caveolin is a muscle-specific                         form that is localized to the sarcolemma.</p>					  <strong>2. How was the interaction between Caveolin-3 and Dysferlin demonstrated?</strong>					  <p>Caveolin-3 and Dysferlin were shown to interact weakly in normal biopsied muscle by coimmunoprecipitation. Seven sites in Dysferlin                         correspond to micro-domains believed to bind the caveolin-3 scaffolding region.                        <em><br>Matsuda et al., Human Molecular Genetics 10 (17): 1761-1766</em> 				      <p>Caveolins are required for Dysferlin trafficking ö Caveolin-1 or Caveolin-3 mutants cause accumulation of Dysferlin in the Golgi                         complex.                       <em><br>Hernandez-Deviez et al., Human Molecular Genetics 15 (1): 129-142</em></p>                          Caveolin-3 and Dysferlin show only limited co-localization at the sarcolemma in mature muscle fibers and Dysferlin is not                          particularly enriched in caveolae. It was suggested that the weak association between the two proteins may occur during dysferlin                          trafficking but not at the membrane.                      <em><br>Hernandez-Deviez et al., Human Molecular Genetics 15 (1): 129-142</em>					  <p><strong>3. Have knock-out mice been generated for Caveolin-3? If yes, what is their phenotype?</strong></p>					  <p>Caveolin-3  knockout mice show mild myopathic changes in their skeletal muscle fibers,  which are also characterized by aberrant                         trafficking of the  dystrophin-glycoprotein complex to lipid raft microdomains and abnormal  organization of the T-tubule system.                      <em><br>Galbiati et al., JBC 276 (24): 21425-21433</em></p>                          Caveolin-3  knockout also results in progressive cardiomyopathy in the heart, and in  addition is associated with increased                          adiposity and whole body insulin  resistance.                      <em>Woodman et al., JBC 277 (41): 38988-38997</em></p>					  <em><br>Capozza et al., Am J  Physiol Cell Physiol 288: C1317-C1331</br></em>					  <p><strong>4. Are there any naturally occurring Caveolin-3 mutations and/or deficiencies know to be associated with human disorders?					  </strong></p>                      <p>Mutations in Caveolin-3 are associated with numerous muscle pathologies - autosomal dominant LGMD1C, distal myopathy, hyperCKemia                       and rippling muscle disease (RMD).</p>					  <p><strong>5.	How are the levels of Caveolin-3 secondarily affected in case of Dysferlin-deficiency?</strong></p>					  Dysferlin has been reported to be abnormally localized in LGMD1C. Membrane staining of Dysferlin is patchy and variable in intensity. In one LGMD1C patient, speckled cytoplasmic staining was observed. Though Caveolin-3 deficiency secondarily reduces Dysferlin, the opposite is not true all the time. It was proposed that this may be because Caveolin-3 is more tightly bound to the membrane and does not change when Dysferlin is absent. <br><em>Matsuda et al., Human Molecular Genetics 10 (17): 1761-1766</br><br>Walter et al., J Neurology 250 (12): 1431-1438</br><br>Campanaro et al., Human Molecular Genetics 11 (26): 3283-3298</em></br>                  </p></td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td>&nbsp;</td>              </tr>            </table></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td bgcolor="#FDFFC6" align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>            <td bgcolor="ffffff">&nbsp;</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td height="30" align="right" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"></td>            <td height="30" align="right" valign="middle" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"><p class="footer">                <? include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>              </p>            </td>          </tr>        </table></td>        <td background="../images/bg_dot.gif" width="1"></td>      </tr>    </table>    <table width="780" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td height="4" background="../images/bg_green.gif"></td>      </tr>    </table>		</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
