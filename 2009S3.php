Mutations in dysferlin were identified as the cause for LGMD2B and Miyoshi Myopathy. In skeletal muscle dysferlin is predominantly found at the muscle membrane where it is believed to play an active role in patch-fusion repair. A dysfunctional membrane repair system was therefore postulated as a pathogenic mechanism for LGMD2B. However, several studies have highlighted that dysferlin is a dynamic protein whose localization depends on the conditions studied. We hypothesize that a comprehensive insight into the dynamics of dysferlin and its complex partners is crucial to understanding dysferlin protein function. Previously we have shown that by making use of two independent affinity binders specific for dysferlin and derived from the llama heavy chain antibody repertoire, we could reproducibly immunoprecipitate dysferlin protein complexes from skeletal muscle. This allowed us to identify two partners in the dysferlin protein complex – AHNAK and calpain 3- as well as their regulation. To further scrutinize the dysferlin protein complex we are currently refining our immunoprecipitation protocols to accommodate the biologically relevant conditions that govern dysferlin behaviour. For this we use myogenic cell lines (C2C12 and IM2) as a model system. As recent studies confirmed the presence of dysferlin on non-skeletal muscle cells we have in parallel begun to identify additional sources of dysferlin protein complexes (cardiomyocytes and monocytes) and are optimising immunoprecipitation protocols and subsequent mass spectrometry analyses for these specific dysferlin sources as well. Thus, by deploying our immunoprecipitation strategy on a large scale we aim to increase our understanding of the dysferlin associated protein complex in a spatiotemporal context.

Although it is clear that dysferlin is essential for rapid calcium-mediated membrane resealing, very little is known regarding how dysferlin performs this role. It is widely believed that dysferlin functions as a calcium-regulated fusogen at the plasma membrane, playing a central role in vesicular-mediated membrane resealing. Thus, our research has focused on defining the plasma membrane biology of dysferlin, which can then be used as a template to examine the consequences of patient-derived mutations, and as a reference to examine the roles of calcium and C2 domains upon dysferlin trafficking and membrane biology. We have shown that under normal conditions, dysferlin resides at the plasma membrane of cultured myotubes for around 3-4 hours. Our data establishes that dysferlin is a relatively transitory plasma membrane protein; perhaps accounting for its defective membrane localization in the skeletal muscle of many patients with muscular dystrophy. Studies of a severely truncated dysferlin construct, C2F-TM (bearing only the most C-terminal C2 domain and transmembrane domain), reveal that elements within the dysferlin N-terminal domain regulate stable PM anchorage. C2F-TM has a much more transitory life at the plasma membrane of only 1 hour, and is rapidly endocytosed and degraded. If dysferlin is indeed required at the plasma membrane to perform its role in membrane repair, factors or domains influencing dysferlin plasma membrane expression are relevant to its role in membrane resealing. Thus, we have studied a suite of dysferlin expression constructs, each bearing deletion or mutation of various C2 domains, and identified a particular role for C2C in modulation of dysferlin plasma membrane expression. We are now studying the nature of interaction mediated by C2C, and the relationship between the abnormal plasma membrane biology of C2C mutants to their functional role in membrane resealing.

                  <strong>Dysferlin: From Bedside to Bench and Back</strong><br>
<br>
Our work on dysferlin was inspired by a LGMD2B family in which two severely affected
sisters where homozygous for a dysferlin null mutation. Their mildly affected compound
heterozygous mother harbored, in addition to one null allele, an in-frame exon-skipping
mutation due to a novel lariat branch point mutation. Despite the lack of a functional C2D
domain, the mother’s internally truncated dysferlin molecule appeared to partially
complement the null mutation, suggesting that certain dysferlin domains may be
dispensable. This observation led us to study the biochemical function of individual
dysferlin C2 domains and to characterize their lipid binding specificity. To better understand
the cellular function of dysferlin, we set out to identify novel protein binding partners. Using
affinity purification followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we have identified
a number of proteins in skeletal muscle, which showed association with dysferlin. The
newly identified proteins fall into categories of surface membrane proteins, proteins involved
in cellular trafficking and in protein degradation. Mapping experiments are ongoing to determine which dysferlin domains
are important for these protein interactions. The insight gained will allow the identification of dysferlin domains that would
be dispensable in small recombinantly generated mini-dysferlin molecules, suitable for AAV mediated gene transfer. I
will outline the progress of our laboratory in those studies.</p>

                  <strong>3D Structure of Human Dysferlin: One Piece at a Time</strong><br>
<br>
Dysferlin is a 237kDa multi-domain protein that is expressed at high levels in muscle tissue, and appears to play a critical role in resealing tears in the muscle cell phospholipid membranes. Mutations within the dysferlin gene can result in Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2B) in humans, presumably resulting from an impaired ability to reseal damaged muscle tissue. While there is a considerable amount of biological data compiled for dysferlin, little structural or biophysical information has been collected. Our long-term plan is to solve the structure of dysferlin from the smallest folding unit (the individual C2 domain) to the largest ensemble of domains. Dysferlin is made up of 7 C2 domains(labeled C2A-C2G), which are evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasmic part of the protein. Interestingly, some of these domains share structural similarity to the Type I C2 domains of synaptotagmin, while others share a topology with Type II C2 domains. The significance of this secondary structure arrangement is unknown. We have also discovered that there is a large central domain that shares significant sequence similarity with glutamine synthetase. If this sequence relationship is accurate, then dysferlin could form into a homo-hexameric structure in the presence of glutamine much like glutamine synthetase. We plan to solve the X-ray crystal structure of each C2 domain and to investigate the putative hexameric region of dysferlin. Each resulting structure will be docked into an EM reconstruction of the entire cytoplasmic region of the protein to yield a pseudo-atomic view of the entire dysferlin protein. This information will be essential to understand how dysferlin functions in the cell, and how to best design therapies to treat the disease.</p>
