                  <strong>Role of Muscle Stem Cells in the Progression and Treatment of Dysferlinopathy</strong><br>

<br>

Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2) and Miyoshi myopathy arise from mutations that disrupt the function of the dysferlin gene and cause slowly progressive weakening and wasting of skeletal muscle. We are investigating the mechanisms by which loss of dysferlin leads to impairment of muscle maintenance and regenerative potential. To this end, we have used direct cell sorting based on surface marker expression to quantify and purify skeletal muscle precursors (SMPs), which function as endogenous muscle stem cells, from dysferlin-deficient (dysfdef) mice. These analyses demonstrated a profound ageassociated reduction in SMP frequency in dystrophic muscles of dysfdef mice, and a significant impairment of their proliferative capacity. Transplantation of wild-type SMPs into dysfdef recipients yielded robust engraftment, with extensive incorporation of dysferlin expressing donor nuclei into the host tissue. In contrast, delivery of wild-type blood cells or circulating factors, through parabiosis to a wild-type partner, failed to support cell engraftment and did not slow disease progression, as assessed histologically. Together, these studies reinforce the notion that muscle pathology in dysfdef animals arises primarily through muscle-intrinsic defects and demonstrate that dysfunction of muscle stem cells may be a contributing factor that limits repair potential in dysfdef muscle. Transplantation of muscle regenerative SMPs may present a viable approach for cell based therapy to restore dysferlin function in dysfdef muscle.</p>

The limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) are a heterogeneous group of genetically determined progressive muscle disorders characterized by great inter and intrafamilial clinical variability. At least 20 different LGMD genes have been mapped or identified to date. LGMD2B or dysferlinopathy, accounts for ~ 20% of autosomal recessive LGMD in the Brazilian population. The search for treatment has been a great challenge for all forms of muscular dystrophies. Stem cell research has opened new promising possibilities allowing the investigation of gene expression in cell lineages derived from affected patients as well as through cell therapy. We are currently investigating the potential of mesenchymal stem cells from different origins, as a source of muscle cells, in various animal models. The murine model for LGMD2B, the SJL mice, carry a deletion in the dysferlin gene that causes a reduction in the protein levels to 15% of normal. We have injected human adipose stromal cells (hASCs) intravenously, without immunosuppression, into 14 SJL mice, divided in two groups of 7. One group received injections of undifferentiated hASCs while the other received hASCs pre-committed to myogenic phenotype, expressing MyoD. These animals were injected each month for 6 months, followed for 9 months and compared with a control group of 7 non-injected SJL mice. Our aim was to assess the hASCs ability to engraft into recipient dystrophic muscle, form chimeric human/mouse muscle fibers, express human muscle proteins in the dystrophic host and improve muscular performance. We showed for the first time that undifferentiated hASCs were not rejected after systemic injection even without immunosuppression. Further, they were able to fuse with the host muscle, express a significant amount of human muscle proteins and improve motor ability. These results may have important applications in future therapies for muscular dystrophies. </p>

                  <strong>Skeletal Muscle Perivascular Cells: Possible Cell Therapy Source for Dysferlinopathy</strong><br>
<br>

We have characterized skeletal muscle perivascular cells (SMPC) identified as Sca-1+/CD34+/CD31-/CD45- cells that exhibit myogenic and angiogenic potential in vivo and in vitro. These cells can be ex vivo expanded for more than 10 passages and can be efficiently transduced with lentiviral vectors. In order to assess the potential use of these perivascular cells for cell therapeutics for dysferlinopathy, we studied their capacity to engraft and restore dysferlin expression in two transplantation settings: autologous and allogeneic transplants. For autologous transplants, SMPC were derived from A/J muscles and transduced with lentiviral vectors containing dysferlin variant 1 and dysferlin variant 2. We obtained high transduction efficiency (50-80%) with vectors carrying both variants. We also obtained high myogenic and angiogenic engraftment when autologous, reconstituted SMPC were transplanted intra-muscularly in A/J mice. Allogeneic transplantation of GFP SMPC also results in high myogenic and angiogenic engraftment in short term transplants (2 weeks). However, immune rejection of GFP SMPC is seen after 4 weeks. Thus, we explored the use of bone marrow (BM) chimeras to induce immune tolerance to wild type SMPC. BM mononuclear cells and SMPC were harvested from transgenic GFP mice, which ubiquitously express GFP under the chicken b-actin promoter. GFP BM cells were transplanted intravenously into lethally irradiated A/J mice and SMPC derived from muscles of the same donor mice were ex vivo expanded. 6 months post BM marrow transplants, GFP SMPC from the same donor were intramuscularly transplanted in the left TA and left quadriceps of BM chimeras as well as age and gender-matched immune-competent A/J mice. 2 months post SMPC transplant, more than 50% of all perivascular cells were GFP positive (donor derived) in BM chimeras whereas no GFP positive cells survived in the immune competent transplants. These studies were confirmed by western blots and FACS. In summary, SMPC are perivascular cells that exhibit myogenic and angiogenic capacity when transplanted in A/J mice and show promise to be used in autologous and allogeneic transplants as cell therapy for dysferlinopathy.</p>

                  <strong>Myoblast Transplantation: a Potential Treatment for LGMD2B</strong><br>
Jacques P. Tremblay, Daniel Skuk, Martin Paradis<br><br>

Myoblasts are muscle precursor cells obtained by the proliferation of muscle stem cells called satellite cells. They are the main cells responsible for natural repair of the muscle fibers following their damage. During this repair process, the myoblasts fuse with the remaining muscle fibers and introduce their own nuclei into the muscle fiber syncytia. When these myoblasts are obtained from a healthy donor, they contain a complete set of normal genes and thus introduce in the muscle fiber copies of genes that can correct several recessive muscular dystrophies. Thus myoblast transplantation is a form of gene therapy where the vector is a cell that naturally repairs muscle fibers. The great advantage of myoblasts is that they can be extensively proliferated, indeed 20 millions myoblasts can be obtained from a single satellite cell. Although, the transplantation of freshly isolated satellite cells has been reported to be more effective on a per cell basis, the extensive proliferation of myoblasts give them an important advantage for a human treatment because the size of the muscle biopsy of a donor is limited. Moreover, our recent experiments have demonstrated that the transplanted myoblasts not only fuse with the damaged muscle fibers and form new muscle fibers, but also generate mononucleated muscle-precursor cells (probably satellite cells) that can participate in further muscle repair. Our recent Phase I clinical trial and a compassionate treatment of myoblast transplantation in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients have clearly proven that this treatment can restore the expression of normal dystrophin in up to 34% of the patient muscle fibers. The presence of the normal gene and the normal mRNA was clearly proven by PCR and RT-PCR amplifications of exons deleted in the patients genome. Moreover, in several of the cases, the presence of the normal dystrophin protein in the sarcolemma was demonstrated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the part of the protein coded by the exons deleted in the patients. Previous experiments of our research group in SJL mice have shown that the transplantation of normal myoblasts can restore the expression of dysferlin in these mice (Leriche-Guérin et al. Neur. Dis. 2002). Thus the possibility of treating LGMD2B by myoblast transplantation merits to be tested in a Phase I clinical trial.</p>

                  <strong>A Gene-Modified Stem Cell Strategy for Correction of Dysferlin Deficiency</strong><br>
Annahita Keravala, Lauren Woodard, Eddie Jung, Michele Calos<br><br>

A series of impressive studies from the laboratory of Guilio Cossu and others have documented the ability of blood vessel-derived mesoangioblast stem cells to migrate and engraft in degenerating muscles and produce competent muscle fibers. Building upon this work, we have set out to demonstrate a cell therapy strategy that utilizes autologouslyderived patient-specific stem cells, in order to avoid immune rejection and the need for immunosuppression. We correct autologous mesoangioblasts by addition of the wild-type dysferlin gene using the phiC31 integrase system. This phage integrase performs efficient sequence-specific integration in mammalian genomes. We have demonstrated that this plasmid-mediated gene addition system can be readily transfected into murine mesoangioblasts and results in efficient integration of therapeutic and marker genes into the genome. The gene-modified mesoangioblasts are then injected into disease model mice, where the injected cells are tracked by luciferase live imaging, GFP fluorescence, and dysferlin staining. We will present the results of our studies to date, examining the in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential of gene-modified mesoangioblasts and their capacity to migrate and engraft in vivo and produce functional muscle fibers.</p>

Mutations in the gene encoding Dysferlin are involved in LGMD-2B and MM. Currently there is no treatment available for these diseases. We characterized dysferlin expression in normal human CD133+ stem cells obtained from both circulating blood and muscle, either alone or in co-culture experiments with normal or dysferlin null mouse-derived myotubes. We designed anti-sense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting consensus regions important to direct splicing machinery, for patients carrying relevant mutations in dysferlin exons. We also tested novel approaches for compensating mutations at the 3’ end of introns that affect lariat formation or acceptor site recognition, involving bi-functional (“tailed”) antisense RNAs. The efficiency of skipping was tested by RT-PCR on CD133 + stem cell isolated from LGMD-2B or MM patients. Moreover, we tested the function of re-expressed dysferlin, before and after engraftment of human skipped CD133+ cells in a immuno-depressed mouse model of dysferlinopathy (Scid/Dysf-/-). The expected outcome is a set of versatile molecular tools and approaches for antisense delivery, applicable to an extended number of mutations in the context of dysferlinopathies.</p>
