                  <strong>Response of Dysferlin-Null Muscle to Injury by Lengthening Contractions: Recovery
of Function, Membrane Resealing, and Inflammation </strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>

Robert J. Bloch, Lisa Ru, Joseph A. Roche<br><br>

We examined the response of dysferlin-null TA muscles in the A/J mouse to large-strain
and small-strain injuries induced by lengthening contractions. We tested the survival of
injured fibers, contractile function, uptake and retention of fluorescein dextran (FDx, 10 kDa,
fixable) during and after injury, and labeling by membrane permeability probes on d3 after
injury. We also characterized the mononuclear cells in injured muscle. A/J and control mice
initially respond similarly to injury from large- and small-strain lengthening contractions,
losing 40-45% of their contractile function. Controls recover from large-strain injury rapidly
(by d3) by membrane resealing, whereas A/J mice require ~2 wks to recover completely by
myogenesis. After small-strain injury, both A/J and control mice recover by myogenesis,
but A/J mice recover 1 wk later than controls. Similar numbers of myofibers in A/J and controls retained FDx through d3
after either injury. At d3, many A/J myofibers labeled with FDx failed to label with a second permeability marker,
suggesting that their membranes had resealed at the time of injury and remained resealed until d3. Other fibers were
labeled with the second marker, indicating secondary injury. These results do not depend on the molecular sizes of the
markers used (3–40 kDa). A/J muscles after large-strain injury, and both A/J and controls after small-strain injury, were
infiltrated by mononuclear cells on d3, but 3-5 fold more were present in A/J. Immunolabeling showed that most were
macrophages. Our results suggest that A/J muscles, like controls, can reseal their sarcolemmal membranes after
injuries caused by lengthening contractions, but that within a few days they undergo massive inflammation, leading to
necrotic death of myofibers labeled at the time of injury and of nearby fibers. We postulate that the delayed recovery of
A/J muscles is due to the time needed for fibers killed by macrophages to be replaced by myogenesis.

                  <strong>Developing the Hypothesis that Dysferlin is Required for Stabilizing Muscle T-tubule
Connections to the Sarcolemma </strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>
John Heuser, Lucy Loultcheva,Tanya Tenkova, Robyn Roth<br>


<br> 
We will advance the hypothesis in this talk that muscle T-tubules are uniquely vulnerable to
damage during eccentric contractions, and that dysferlin plays a role in stabilizing T-tubule
connections with the plasma membrane, or re-establishing connections with the plasma
membrane if and when T-tubules are damaged by this sort of contraction. Further, we will
argue that the reason for this T-tubule vulnerability, which is unique to muscle, is due to the
fact that the surface-membrane of the muscle fiber, the sarcolemma, is pinned down to the
special extracellular matrix that surrounds all muscle fibers and stabilizes them, so the
surface membrane cannot slip laterally. We will then explain how the T-tubule system,
which connects everywhere to the sarcolemma in order to spread excitation throughout the muscle fiber, is itself pinned down to certain positions in the myofilament lattice of the internal sarcoplasmic contractile apparatus (to the A-I junction in warm-blooded animals and the Z-band in cold-blooded animals). These competing physical constraints, we will argue, mean that whenever the internal myofilament lattice becomes displaced laterally from its natural starting-point distribution relative to the surrounding sarcolemma (as it likely does during eccentric contraction), the T-tubule origins and insertions must become stretched and consequently, T-tubules must become vulnerable to rupture or evulsion from the cell surface. We will further consider the likelihood that this sort of T-tubule evulsion would interrupt excitation-contraction coupling in the affected region of the muscle fiber and likely cause a local flaccid paralysis, which could promote further plasmalemmal/sarcomere dislocation and further T-tubule rupture, thus propagating the muscle damage. Finally, we will offer that if dysferlin is not the protein that helps to prevent such T-tubule damage or helps to heal it, then discovering whatever protein does do this job will become just as important for understanding the muscular dystrophies, as is understanding the role of dysferlin itself.                </p>

                  <strong>In Vivo Proof that Calcium Underlies Skeletal Muscle Degeneration in Muscular
Dystrophy</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>
Doug P. Millay, Sanjeewa Goonasekera, Jeffery D. Molkentin</p>
				<p>				  Muscular Dystrophy (MD) is a muscle wasting disease that arises due to mutations in a
multitude of genes. However, in recent years it has become apparent that many of these
mutant genes function within a similar pathway or overall biologic process that safeguards
the sarcolemma of a skeletal muscle fiber. Intermittent tears in the cell membrane, or
activation of select ion channels, permits infusion of calcium that presumably induces
cellular degeneration and necrosis of whole muscle fibers. While this hypothesis was
proposed over two decades ago, it has yet to be definitively evaluated in vivo, and
establishing such a paradigm should have significant therapeutic implications especially
given existing pharmacologic agents that could be used to address a dysregulation in
calcium homeostasis. For example, we show that in transgenic mice overexpression of transient receptor potential canonical3 (TRPC3) channel (TRPC channels are known to be dysregulated in MD) can induce calcium entry and initiate massive necrotic disease in skeletal muscle that is highly reminiscent of MD. Moreover, inhibition of endogenous TRPC channels by overexpression of dominant negative mutants in skeletal muscle mitigated disease in both mdx and Scgd-/- (delta-sarcoglycan) mice. Similarly, increased expression of the sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) isoform induces MD like disease through reverse mode calcium entry in all muscles except the diaphragm, and skeletal muscle specific deletion of the NCX1 gene using Cre-loxP technology, mitigated disease in mdx, A/J and Scgd-/- mice. We also generated transgenic mice with SERCA1 overexpression in skeletal muscle as an independent mechanism of clearing calcium from the cytosol, which also mitigated disease in mdx and Scgd-/- mice. Taken together, these results indicate that calcium itself can induce skeletal muscle dystrophic-like disease, without a defect in the sarcolemma. Moreover, enhancing calcium clearance or preventing increased TRPC activity effectively reduced skeletal muscle disease in 2 different mouse models of MD. Finally, we also generated transgenic mice with skeletal muscle-specific dysferlin overexpression. Crossing the dysferlin transgene into the A/J background completely rescued MD, demonstrating that disease in the A/J mouse is autonomous to skeletal muscle cells only. However, overexpression of dysferlin in Scgd-/- mice had no effect in reducing MD. </p>
