                  <strong>Analysis of the DYSF Mutational Spectrum: Novel Insights and Novel Tools for Large-Scale Routine Diagnosis of Primary Dysferlinopathie</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>

<br>

The identification of deleterious mutations in patients affected with dysferlinopathy is an essential initial step, which constitutes a pre-requisite for accurate genetic counselling, follow-up and possible inclusion in future therapeutic clinical trials. 
As the French national reference centre for molecular diagnosis of primary dysferlinopathies, we received to date more than 220 patient samples for genomic mutational screening.  Disease-causing mutations identified in this cohort correspond to more than 25% of all DYSF mutations reported to date. Genomic mutational screening allowed for the identification of both disease-causing mutations in approximately 70% of patients. We are currently developing several complementary analyses with the aim of exhaustive genomic mutational analysis.
For the compilation and interactive analysis of mutational data, we developed a Locus-Specific database, the Universal Mutation Database for Dysferlin (UMD-DYSF, in collaboration with Christophe Béroud, Montpellier, France).  This database includes several bioinformatic tools which allow for the statistical analysis of mutational data.  We precisely analysed the mutational spectrum in 134 patients, included based on clinical suspicion of primary dysferlinopathy and/or dysferlin protein deficiency identified on muscle biopsy samples.  Most of the identified mutations are predicted to produce a truncated protein or one amino-acid substitution, but we also report a high proportion of nonsense mutations as compared to previous studies.  The database also includes specific algorithms for the prediction of a pathogenicity score, for newly identified intronic, missense- or isosemantic-exonic sequence variants, and is therefore a valuable bioinformatic support for genetic diagnosis in primary dysferlinopathies.

                  <strong>Prognostic Factors in Dysferlinopathy Progression</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>

C. Angelini, C. Borsato, R. Padoan, M. Fanin, E. Pegoraro<br><br>

LGMD2B or dysferlinopathy is due to a mutation in dysferlin, a protein involved in membrane repair.  Dysferlinopathy might present with different clinical phenotypes such as a distal or proximal myopathy or a cramp/myalgia syndrome with hyperCKemia.  The disease progression is highly variable in patients from the same family, implying that epigenetic factors such as muscle fatigue, autophagy and physical activity, that produce different types of either mechanical or inflammatory stress, could determine a different muscular injury and recovery.  We investigated whether strenuous physical activity before onset might influence the disease clinical progression in 11 cases.  We also analysed by quantitative histopathology 25 cases and evaluated MHC1 molecules and markers of degeneration/regeneration.  Only patients with a defined molecular diagnosis of LGMD2B were included, all patients were evaluated and graded with a modified Gardner–Medwin and Walton clinical scale and statistically analyzed by Cox multivariate and Log rank.  
We divided the patients in two groups:  five of 11 patients never performed regular physical activity, six performed competitive physical activity until disease started (at least 3 hours/week for 2 years of continuous physical training).  Six /11 patients (mean age: 25 years) did physical activity in a series of agonistic sports (soccer, basket, volleyball and swimming) before the disease onset; five of 11 patients (mean age: 31 years) never performed any sport.  Sportive patients presented a more rapid clinical progression and early loss of limb muscle strength.  Time to reach stage (loss of Gowers) of modified Gardner-Medwin and Walton scale was 5.75 years in sportive patients and 10 years in non-sportive patients (Cox test: p=0.11; Log rank: p=0.09).  In agreement with our previous study an inflammatory response (Fanin M, Angelini C, Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 28;461-470, 2002) was seen in most cases.  The highest rate of degeneration /regeneration and acute inflammation was found in patients younger than 30 years:  clinicians should be aware of these inflammatory reactions and avoid unnecessary steroids; in 2 patients an immunomodulatory treatment with IVIG for 6 months was unsuccessful. 
All LGMD2B patients showed a progressive loss of muscle function but patients that performed physical activity had a significantly more rapid clinical evolution and this should be considered as a negative prognostic factor, which might influence disease progression.

                  <strong>What We Learned, Didn’t Learn, and Might Still Learn from the MYO-029 Trial of Myostatin Inhibition in Adult Muscular Dystrophy</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>

<br>

Within the past year, the results of the Phase I/II trial of a neutralizing antibody to myostatin in adult muscular dystrophy have been analyzed and published.  This was the first clinical trial to include many of the limb girdle muscular dystrophies, including dysferlinopathies.  The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, randomized study of MYO-029 over 6 months plus a 3 month follow up.  MYO-029 had good safety and tolerability with the exception of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions at higher doses.  The study was not powered to evaluate for efficacy and no statistically significant increases in muscle mass, strength or function were found.  Consistent trends in muscle fiber diameters and muscle mass were observed.  Analysis of the data as a whole as well as individual data points, suggest important ways in which endpoints could be refined for future clinical trials in dysferlinopathies as well as other adult muscular dystrophies. </p>
