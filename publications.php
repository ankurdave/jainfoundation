Deficiency of the dysferlin protein presents as two major clinical phenotypes:
Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi Myopathy (MM).
Dysferlin is known to participate in membrane repair, providing a potential
hypothesis to the underlying pathophysiology of these diseases. The size of the
dysferlin cDNA prevents its direct incorporation into an Adeno-Associated-Virus
(AAV) vector for therapeutic gene transfer into muscle. To bypass this
limitation, we split the dysferlin cDNA at the exon 28/29 junction and cloned it 
into two independent AAV vectors carrying the appropriate splicing sequences.
Intramuscular injection of the corresponding vectors into a dysferlin-deficient
mouse model led to the expression of full-length dysferlin for at least one year.
Importantly, systemic injection in the tail vein of the two vectors led a
widespread although weak expression of the full length protein. Injections were
associated with an improvement of the histological aspect of the muscle, a
reduction in the number of necrotic fibers, restoration of membrane repair
capacity and a global improvement in locomotor activity. Altogether, these data
support the use of such a strategy for the treatment of dysferlin deficiency.

Glucocorticoids are beneficial in many muscular dystrophies but they are
ineffective in treating dysferlinopathy, a rare muscular dystrophy caused by loss
of dysferlin. We sought to understand the molecular basis for this disparity by
studying the effects of a glucocorticoid on differentiation of the myoblast cell 
line, C2C12, and dysferlin-deficient C2C12s. We found that pharmacologic doses of
dexamethasone enhanced the myogenic fusion efficiency of C2C12s and increased the
induction of dysferlin, along with specific myogenic transcription factors,
sarcolemmal and structural proteins. In contrast, the dysferlin-deficient C2C12
cell line demonstrated a reduction in long myotubes and early induction of
particular muscle differentiation proteins, most notably, myosin heavy chain.
Dexamethasone partially reversed the defect in myogenic fusion in the
dysferlin-deficient C2C12 cells. We hypothesize that a key therapeutic benefit of
glucocorticoids may be the up-regulation of dysferlin as an important component
of glucocorticoid-enhanced myogenic differentiation. Copyright © 2009 Elsevier

The recently described human anion channel Anoctamin (ANO) protein family comprises at least ten members, many of which have been shown to correspond to calcium-activated chloride channels. To date, the only reported human mutations in this family of genes are dominant mutations in ANO5 (TMEM16E, GDD1) in the rare skeletal disorder gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia. We have identified recessive mutations in ANO5 that result in a proximal limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2L) in three French Canadian families and in a distal non-dysferlin Miyoshi myopathy (MMD3) in Dutch and Finnish families. These mutations consist of a splice site, one base pair duplication shared by French Canadian and Dutch cases, and two missense mutations. The splice site and the duplication mutations introduce premature-termination codons and consequently trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting an underlining loss-of-function mechanism. The LGMD2L phenotype is characterized by proximal weakness, with prominent asymmetrical quadriceps femoris and biceps brachii atrophy. The MMD3 phenotype is associated with distal weakness, of calf muscles in particular. With the use of electron microscopy, multifocal sarcolemmal lesions were observed in both phenotypes. The phenotypic heterogeneity associated with ANO5 mutations is reminiscent of that observed with Dysferlin (DYSF) mutations that can cause both LGMD2B and Miyoshi myopathy (MMD1). In one MMD3-affected individual, defective membrane repair was documented on fibroblasts by membrane-resealing ability assays, as observed in dysferlinopathies. Though the function of the ANO5 protein is still unknown, its putative calcium-activated chloride channel function may lead to important insights into the role of deficient skeletal muscle membrane repair in muscular dystrophies.

TRPC-dependent mechanism.</strong></a><br>

<br>
Muscular dystrophy is a general term encompassing muscle disorders that cause
weakness and wasting, typically leading to premature death. Membrane instability,
as a result of a genetic disruption within the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
(DGC), is thought to induce myofiber degeneration, although the downstream
mechanism whereby membrane fragility leads to disease remains controversial. One 
potential mechanism that has yet to be definitively proven in vivo is that
unregulated calcium influx initiates disease in dystrophic myofibers. Here we
demonstrate that calcium itself is sufficient to cause a dystrophic phenotype in 
skeletal muscle independent of membrane fragility. For example, overexpression of
transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) and the associated increase in
calcium influx resulted in a phenotype of muscular dystrophy nearly identical to 
that observed in DGC-lacking dystrophic disease models, including a highly
similar molecular signature of gene expression changes. Furthermore,
transgene-mediated inhibition of TRPC channels in mice dramatically reduced
calcium influx and dystrophic disease manifestations associated with the mdx
mutation (dystrophin gene) and deletion of the delta-sarcoglycan (Scgd) gene.
These results demonstrate that calcium itself is sufficient to induce muscular
dystrophy in vivo, and that TRPC channels are key disease initiators downstream
of the unstable membrane that characterizes many types of muscular dystrophy.

<br>
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) is a potent stimulus of muscle growth. Myoferlin is a membrane-associated protein important for muscle development and regeneration. Myoferlin-null mice have smaller muscles and defective myoblast fusion. To understand the mechanism by which myoferlin loss retards muscle growth, we found that myoferlin-null muscle does not respond to IGF1. In vivo after IGF1 infusion, control muscle increased myofiber diameter by 25%, but myoferlin-null muscle was unresponsive. Myoblasts cultured from myoferlin-null muscle and treated with IGF1 also failed to show the expected increase in fusion to multinucleate myotubes. The IGF1 receptor colocalized with myoferlin at sites of myoblast fusion. The lack of IGF1 responsiveness in myoferlin-null myoblasts was linked directly to IGF1 receptor mistrafficking as well as decreased IGF1 signaling. In myoferlin-null myoblasts, the IGF1 receptor accumulated into large vesicular structures. These vesicles colocalized with a marker of late endosomes/lysosomes, LAMP2, specifying redirection from a recycling to a degradative pathway. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis showed a marked increase in vacuoles in myoferlin-null muscle. These data demonstrate that IGF1 receptor recycling is required for normal myogenesis and that myoferlin is a critical mediator of postnatal muscle growth mediated by IGF1.-Demonbreun, A. R., Posey, A. D., Heretis, K., Swaggart, K. A., Earley, J. U., Pytel, P., McNally, E. M. Myoferlin is required for insulin-like growth factor response and muscle growth.

Mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin (DYSF; MIM# 603009, 2p13, GenBank NM_003494.2) cause primary dysferlinopathies, which are autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies. DYSF has a large mutational spectrum, and genetic diagnosis is complicated by incomplete mutation detection rates. Recently, novel dysferlin transcripts were characterized by identifying alternative exons 1 of DYSF-v1 (GenBank DQ267935), exon 5a (GenBank DQ976379), and exon 40a (GenBank EF015906). To evaluate the frequency of possible mutations in the newly identified DYSF alternative exons, we screened the corresponding genomic regions for mutations in a cohort of 26 patients, carrying only one mutation undoubtedly considered as disease causing in the 55 canonical DYSF exons. No disease-causing mutation was identified in alternative exons 1 of DYSF-v1, exon 5a, and exon 40a, demonstrating a low frequency of disease-causing mutations in these exons.

Mutations in DYSF encoding dysferlin, cause primary dysferlinopathies, autosomal recessive diseases which mainly present clinically as Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. More than 350 different sequence variants have been reported in DYSF. Like dystrophin, the size of the dysferlin mRNA is above the limited packaging size of AAV vectors. Alternative strategies to AAV gene transfer in muscle cells must then be addressed for patients. A gene therapy approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy was recently developed, based on exon-skipping strategy. Numerous sequences are recognized by splicing protein complexes and, when specifically blocked by antisense oligoucleotides (AON), the corresponding exon is skipped. We hypothesized that this approach could be useful for patients affected with dysferlinopathies. To confirm this assumption, exon 32 was selected as a prioritary target for exon skipping strategy. This option was initially driven by the report from Sinnreich and coll. (2006) of a patient with a very mild and late onset phenotype associated to a natural skipping of exon 32. Three different antisense oligonucleotides were tested in myoblasts generated from control and patient MyoD transduced fibroblasts, either as oligonucleotides or after incorporation into lentiviral vectors. These approaches led to a high efficiency of exon 32 skipping. Therefore, these results seem promising and could be applied to several other exons in the DYSF gene. Patients carrying mutations in exons whose the in frame suppression has been proven to have no major consequences on the protein function, might benefit of exon-skipping based gene correction.

We studied the response of dysferlin-null and control skeletal muscle to large and small strain injuries to the ankle dorsiflexors in mice. We measured contractile torque and counted fibers retaining 10 kDa fluorescein dextran, necrotic fibers, macrophages, fibers with central nuclei and expressing developmental myosin heavy chain, to assess contractile function, membrane resealing, necrosis, inflammation and myogenesis. We also studied recovery after blunting myogenesis with X-irradiation. We report that dysferlin-null myofibers retain 10 kDa dextran for 3 days after large-strain injury but are lost thereafter, following necrosis and inflammation. Recovery of dysferlin-null muscle requires myogenesis, which delays the return of contractile function compared to controls, which recover from large-strain injury by repairing damaged myofibers without significant inflammation, necrosis, or myogenesis. Recovery of control and dysferlin-null muscles from small-strain injury involved inflammation and necrosis followed by myogenesis, all of which were more pronounced in the dysferlin-null, which recovered more slowly. Both control and dysferlin-null muscles also retained 10 kDa dextran for 3 days after small-strain injury. We conclude that dysferlin-null myofibers can survive contraction-induced injury for at least 3 days but are subsequently eliminated by necrosis and inflammation. Myogenesis to replace lost fibers does not appear to be significantly compromised in dysferlin-null mice.

We report for the first time the characterization of disease-causing exonic rearrangements in the large-sized gene encoding dysferlin. A newly developed kit for multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of the dysferlin gene was used for a total of 12 samples from patients with suspected diagnosis of primary dysferlinopathy. This analysis and subsequent genomic quantitative real-time PCR evidenced exonic rearrangements in five patients, including four different exonic deletions and one duplication. Altogether, our findings confirm the existence of exonic rearrangements as disease-causing mutations in primary dysferlinopathies.

Mutations in the gene DYSF, which codes for the protein dysferlin, underlie Miyoshi myopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B in humans and produce a slowly progressing skeletal muscle degenerative disease in mice. Dysferlin is a Ca(2+)-sensing, regulatory protein that is involved in membrane repair after injury. To assess the function of dysferlin in healthy and dystrophic skeletal muscle, we generated skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mice with threefold overexpression of this protein. These mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type, and more importantly, the transgene completely rescued the muscular dystrophy (MD) disease in Dysf-null A/J mice. The dysferlin transgene rescued all histopathology and macrophage infiltration in skeletal muscle of Dysf(-/-) A/J mice, as well as promoted the rapid recovery of muscle function after forced lengthening contractions. These results indicate that MD in A/J mice is autonomous to skeletal muscle and not initiated by any other cell type. However, overexpression of dysferlin did not improve dystrophic symptoms or membrane instability in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex-lacking Scgd (delta-sarcoglycan) null mouse, indicating that dysferlin functionality is not a limiting factor underlying membrane repair in other models of MD. In summary, the restoration of dysferlin in skeletal muscle fibers is sufficient to rescue the MD in Dysf-deficient mice, although its mild overexpression does not appear to functionally enhance membrane repair in other models of MD.

Skeletal muscle requires an efficient and active membrane repair system to overcome the rigours of frequent contraction. Dysferlin is a component of that system and absence of dysferlin causes muscular dystrophy (dysferlinopathy) characterised by adult onset muscle weakness, high serum creatine kinase levels and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. We have observed that dysferlinopathy patient biopsies show an excess of immature fibres and therefore investigated the role of dysferlin in muscle regeneration. Using notexin-induced muscle damage, we have shown that regeneration is attenuated in a mouse model of dysferlinopathy, with delayed removal of necrotic fibres, an extended inflammatory phase and delayed functional recovery. Satellite cell activation and myoblast fusion appear normal, but there is a reduction in early neutrophil recruitment in regenerating and also needle wounded muscle in dysferlin deficient mice. Primary mouse dysferlinopathy myoblast cultures show reduced cytokine release upon stimulation, indicating that the secretion of chemotactic molecules is impaired. We suggest an extension to the muscle membrane repair model where in addition to fusing patch repair vesicles with the sarcolemma dysferlin is also involved in the release of chemotactic agents. Reduced neutrophil recruitment results in incomplete cycles of regeneration in dysferlinopathy which combines with the membrane repair deficit to ultimately trigger dystrophic pathology. This study reveals a novel pathomechanism affecting muscle regeneration and maintenance in dysferlinopathy and highlights enhancement of the neutrophil response as a potential therapeutic avenue in these disorder.

Dysferlinopathies belong to the heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies. Mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin (DYSF) lead to distinct phenotypes, mainly Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Here, we analysed the mutational data from the largest cohort described to date, a cohort of 134 patients, included based on clinical suspicion of primary dysferlinopathy and/or dysferlin protein deficiency identified on muscle biopsy samples. Data were compiled from 38 patients previously screened for mutations in our laboratory (Nguyen, et al., 2005; Nguyen, et al., 2007), and 96 supplementary patients screened for DYSF mutations using genomic DHPLC analysis, and subsequent sequencing of detected variants, in a routine diagnostic setting. In 89 (66%) out of 134 patients, molecular analysis identified two disease causing mutations, confirming the diagnosis of primary Dysferlinopathy on a genetic basis. Furthermore, one mutation was identified in 30 patients, without identification of a second deleterious allele. We are currently developing complementary analysis for patients in whom only one or no disease-causing allele could be identified using the genomic screening procedure. Altogether, 64 novel mutations have been identified in this cohort, which corresponds to approximately 25% of all DYSF mutations reported to date. The mutational spectrum of this cohort significantly shows a higher proportion of nonsense mutations, but a lower proportion of deleterious missense changes as compared to previous series.<br>

Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy. Dysferlin-deficient cells show abnormalities in vesicular traffic and membrane repair although onset of symptoms is not commonly seen until the late teenage years and is often associated with subacute onset and marked muscle inflammation. To identify molecular networks specific to dysferlin-deficient muscle that might explain disease pathogenesis, muscle mRNA profiles from 10 mutation-positive LGMD2B/MM patients were compared with a disease control [LGMD2I; (n = 9)], and normal muscle samples (n = 11). Query of inflammatory pathways suggested LGMD2B-specific increases in co-stimulatory signaling between dendritic cells and T cells (CD86, CD28, and CTLA4), associated with localized expression of both versican and tenascin. LGMD2B muscle also showed an increase in vesicular trafficking pathway proteins not normally observed in muscle (synaptotagmin-like protein Slp2a/SYTL2 and the small GTPase Rab27A). We propose that Rab27A/Slp2a expression in LGMD2B muscle provides a compensatory vesicular trafficking pathway that is able to repair membrane damage in the absence of dysferlin. However, this same pathway may release endocytotic vesicle contents, resulting in an inflammatory microenvironment. As dysferlin deficiency has been shown to enhance phagocytosis by macrophages, together with our findings of abnormal myofiber endocytosis pathways and dendritic-T cell activation markers, these results suggest a model of immune and inflammatory network over-stimulation that may explain the subacute inflammatory presentation.

The protein, dysferlin, mediates sarcolemmal repair in vitro, implicating defective membrane repair in dysferlinopathies. To study the role of dysferlin in vivo, we assessed contractile function, sarcolemmal integrity, and myogenesis before and after injury from large-strain lengthening contractions in dysferlin-null and control mice. We report that dysferlin-null muscles produce higher contractile torque, and are equally susceptible to initial injury but recover from injury more slowly. Two weeks after injury, control muscles retain fluorescein dextran and do not show myogenesis. Dysferlin-null muscles do not retain fluorescein dextran, and show necrosis followed by myogenesis. Our data indicate that recovery of control muscles from injury primarily involves sarcolemmal repair whereas recovery of dysferlin-null muscles primarily involves myogenesis without repair and long-term survival of myofibers.<br><br>

Satellite cells reside beneath the basal lamina of skeletal muscle fibers and include cells that act as precursors for muscle growth and repair. Although they share a common anatomical localization and typically are considered a homogeneous population, satellite cells actually exhibit substantial heterogeneity. We used cell-surface marker expression to purify from the satellite cell pool a distinct population of skeletal muscle precursors (SMPs) that function as muscle stem cells. When engrafted into muscle of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, purified SMPs contributed to up to 94% of myofibers, restoring dystrophin expression and significantly improving muscle histology and contractile function. Transplanted SMPs also entered the satellite cell compartment, renewing the endogenous stem cell pool and participating in subsequent rounds of injury repair. Together, these studies indicate the presence in adult skeletal muscle of prospectively isolatable muscle-forming stem cells and directly demonstrate the efficacy of myogenic stem cell transplant for treating muscle degenerative disease.

BACKGROUND: Although diseases associated with microvascular endothelial dysfunction are among the most prevalent illnesses to date, currently no method exists to isolate pure endothelial cells (EC) from skeletal muscle for in vivo or in vitro study. METHODOLOGY: By utilizing multicolor fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), we have isolated a distinct population of Sca-1(+), CD31(+), CD34(dim) and CD45(- )cells from skeletal muscles of C57BL6 mice. Characterization of this population revealed these cells are functional EC that can be expanded several times in culture without losing their phenotype or capabilities to uptake acetylated low-density lipoprotein (ac-LDL), produce nitric oxide (NO) and form vascular tubes. When transplanted subcutaneously or intramuscularly into the tibialis anterior muscle, EC formed microvessels and integrated with existing vasculature. CONCLUSION: This method, which is highly reproducible, can be used to study the biology and role of EC in diseases such as peripheral vascular disease. In addition this method allows us to isolate large quantities of skeletal muscle derived EC with potential for therapeutic angiogenic applications.

Muscular dystrophies comprise a diverse group of genetic disorders that lead to muscle wasting and, in many instances, premature death. Many mutations that cause muscular dystrophy compromise the support network that connects myofilament proteins within the cell to the basal lamina outside the cell, rendering the sarcolemma more permeable or leaky. Here we show that deletion of the gene encoding cyclophilin D (Ppif) rendered mitochondria largely insensitive to the calcium overload-induced swelling associated with a defective sarcolemma, thus reducing myofiber necrosis in two distinct models of muscular dystrophy. Mice lacking delta-sarcoglycan (Scgd(-/-) mice) showed markedly less dystrophic disease in both skeletal muscle and heart in the absence of Ppif. Moreover, the premature lethality associated with deletion of Lama2, encoding the alpha-2 chain of laminin-2, was rescued, as were other indices of dystrophic disease. Treatment with the cyclophilin inhibitor Debio-025 similarly reduced mitochondrial swelling and necrotic disease manifestations in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and in Scgd(-/-) mice. Thus, mitochondrial-dependent necrosis represents a prominent disease mechanism in muscular dystrophy, suggesting that inhibition of cyclophilin D could provide a new pharmacologic treatment strategy for these diseases.<br>

Dysferlin deficiency causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B; proximal weakness) and Miyoshi myopathy (distal weakness). Muscle inflammation is often present in dysferlin deficiency, and patients are frequently misdiagnosed as having polymyositis. Because monocytes normally express dysferlin, we hypothesized that monocyte/macrophage dysfunction in dysferlin-deficient patients might contribute to disease onset and progression. We therefore examined phagocytic activity, in the presence and absence of cytokines, in freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes from LGMD2B patients and in the SJL dysferlin-deficient mouse model. Dysferlin-deficient monocytes showed increased phagocytic activity compared with control cells. siRNA-mediated inhibition of dysferlin expression in the J774 macrophage cell line resulted in significantly enhanced phagocytosis, both at baseline and in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for several mononuclear cell activation markers in LGMD2B human muscle and SJL mouse muscle. SJL muscle showed strong up-regulation of endocytic proteins CIMPR, clathrin, and adaptin-alpha, and LGMD2B muscle exhibited decreased expression of decay accelerating factor, which was not dysferlin-specific. We further showed that expression levels of small Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc 42 were increased in dysferlin-deficient murine immune cells compared with control cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that mild myofiber damage in dysferlin-deficient muscle stimulates an inflammatory cascade that may initiate, exacerbate, and possibly perpetuate the underlying myofiber-specific dystrophic process.<br>

Dysferlin and caveolin-3 are plasma membrane proteins associated with muscular dystrophy. Patients with mutations in the caveolin-3 gene show dysferlin mislocalization in muscle cells. By utilizing caveolin-null cells, expression of caveolin mutants, and different mutants of dysferlin, we have dissected the site of action of caveolin with respect to dysferlin trafficking pathways. We now show that caveolin-1 or -3 can facilitate exit of a dysferlin mutant which accumulates in the Golgi complex of Cav1-/- cells. In contrast, wild type dysferlin reaches the plasma membrane but is rapidly endocytosed in Cav1-/- cells. We demonstrate that the primary effect of caveolin is to cause surface retention of dysferlin. Caveolin-1 or caveolin-3, but not specific caveolin mutants, inhibit endocytosis of dysferlin through a clathrin-independent pathway colocalizing with internalized glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Our results provide new insights into the role of this endocytic pathway in surface remodelling of specific surface components. In addition, they highlight a novel mechanism of action of caveolins relevant to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying caveolin-associated disease. <br>

Many of the mutations associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy can   potentially be rescued by exon-skipping therapy, targeting selected exons of   prespliced mRNA for the dystrophin gene with antisense oligonucleotides, thereby   restoring reading frames. The recent development of antisense oligonucleotides   with higher stability and lower toxicity, such as morpholinos, has made it   possible to restore dystrophin efficiently in dystrophic mice in vivo with no   obvious side effects. There seems little doubt that such exon-skipping therapy   is destined to proceed to the clinical application stage in patients with   Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One of the remaining issues to be addressed is the   skipping of multiple exons because such multi-exon skipping therapy could expand   the potential patient target population to include 80% of those with duplication   mutations and 90% of those with deletion mutations. At present, this multi-exon   skipping strategy is being investigated in dystrophic dogs as well as dystrophic   mice. There are several challenges that still need to be overcome, including the   low uptake of antisense oligonucleotides into the heart and the need to design   efficient, nontoxic, cost-effective oligonucleotides. This review summarizes   recent progress in exon-skipping therapy and discusses future perspectives with   regard to human clinical trials. <br>

                      The dysferlin gene is mutated in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi   myopathy, and distal anterior compartment myopathy. In mature skeletal muscle,   dysferlin is located predominantly at the sarcolemma, where it plays a role in   membrane fusion and repair. To investigate the role of dysferlin during early   muscle differentiation, its localization was studied at high resolution in a   muscle cell line. This demonstrated that dysferlin is not expressed at the   plasmalemma of myotubes but mostly localizes to the T-tubule network. However,   dysferlin translocated to the site of injury and toward the plasma membrane in a   Ca2+-dependent fashion in response to a newly designed in vitro wounding assay.   This reaction was specific to the full-length protein, as heterologously   expressed deletion mutants of distinct C2 domains of dysferlin did not show this   response. These results shed light on the dynamics of muscle membrane repair and   are highly indicative of a specific role of dysferlin in this process in early   myogenesis. <br>

                      Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B form (LGMD-2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM)   are both caused by mutations in the dysferlin (dysf) gene. In this study, we   used dysferlin-deficient sjl mice as a mouse model to study cell therapy for   LGMD-2B and MM. A single-blind study evaluated the therapeutic potential of   human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) as a source of myogenic progenitor stem cells.   Three groups of donor cells were used: unfractionated mononuclear HUCB cells,   HUCB subfractionated to enrich for cells that were negative for lineage surface   markers (LIN(-)) and substantially enriched for the CD34 surface marker   (CD34(+)), and irradiated control spleen cells. We administrated 1 x 10(6) donor   cells to each animal intravenously and euthanized them at different time points   (1-12 weeks) after transplantation. All animals were immunosuppressed (FK506 and   leflunomide) from the day before the injection until the time of euthanasia.   Immunohistochemical analyses documented that a small number of human cells from   the whole HUCB and LIN(-)CD34(+/-)-enriched HUCB subgroups engraft in the   recipient muscle to express both dysferlin and human-specific dystrophin at 12   weeks after transplantation. We conclude that myogenic progenitor cells are   present in the HUCB, that they can disseminate into muscle after intravenous   administration, and that they are capable of myogenic differentiation in host   muscle.</p>
