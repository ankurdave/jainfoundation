However, stem cell therapies may be combined with ex vivo modification strategies that are specific to dysferlinopathy. <br>				<br>				An essential question for stem cell therapy is what cell type to use for the treatment. There are many different muscle progenitor cell types used by different laboratories, and not much work has been done to determine how these cell types overlap or to systematically test which type gives best results in animal models.<br><br>				Dr. Giulio Cossu discussed mesoangioblasts, which are progenitor cells associated with blood vessels that have been able to partially restore dystrophin expression and ameliorate symptoms in a dog model of muscular dystrophy. One caveat to this work is that he has seen a very variable production of dystrophin in muscle fibers of the recipient dogs and also very variable production of dystrophin from post-natal mesoangioblasts isolated from humans. If such variability is patient-specific, this may mean that careful screening of patients will be required at the time of a clinical trial. There has also not yet been success using autologous, ex vivo modified mesoangioblasts in the dog model, possibly due to low levels of dystrophin production by modified cells. This is an issue that needs to be improved with further research. Dr. Cossu is currently planning a clinical trial with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients, using HLA-matched donor mesoangioblasts transplanted either intramuscularly or intra-arterially, and monitoring for both safety and efficacy (muscle strength improvement). In response to questions following his talk, Dr. Cossu mentioned that all the dogs used in his studies were treated with steroids throughout their lives, and also that he did not observe any production of anti-dystrophin antibody in any of the treated dogs. <br>				<br>				Dr. Morayma Reyes discussed an adult progenitor cell type (multipotent adult progenitor cells, MAPCs) that can be isolated from either bone marrow or muscle. She has focused on these cells because of their ability to multiply in culture more efficiently than other muscle and bone marrow mononuclear cells, and has now developed a method to isolate both these MAPCs and satellite cells by FACS. Culturing cells in low oxygen conditions may mimic the in vivo environment because cells in the body are not exposed to atmospheric concentrations of oxygen, and she has had some success improving proliferation of these cells in low oxygen. The MAPCs share surface markers with vascular and perivascular cells and can be found in the perivascular region of the muscle in situ. Dr. Reyes hypothesized during her talk that many of the stem cell types used by researchers may have vascular origin. <br>				<br>				Dr. Yvan Torrente discussed adult blood-derived progenitors, selected by their cell-surface expression of CD133. Although these cells are isolated from blood, they express a number of muscle markers and are found enriched in the muscle after exercise, suggesting that they may be recruited to muscle after damage in order to help regenerate muscle fibers or to help replentish the muscle stem cell pool. CD133+ stem cells can also be isolated directly from muscle. Dr. Torrente has found successful expression of dystrophin in mdx/SCID mice after autologous transplantation of blood-derived CD133+ cells that had been ex vivo modified by lentiviral insertion of a U7 exon skipping cassette. Dr. Torrente is  planning to repeat his exon skipping experiments on the dysferlin gene in  CD133+ stem cells from human patients. Exon skipping by U7 can achieve permanent skipping, but it does carry the risk of tumors (caused by random insertion of the exon skipping cassette into the genome) that is common to viral gene therapy. During the questions following this talk, it was suggested that ex vivo modification of stem cells might be possible by homologous recombination to replace just a targetted exon, depending on the location of a patient's mutation.<br>				<br>				Dr. Amy Wagers discussed progenitor cells (skeletal muscle precursors, SMPs) isolated from myofiber-associated mononuclear cells. She  selected these cells based on their myogenicity in culture, and has found that they are a subset of muscle satellite cells. These cells could be the sub-population that renews the satellite cell pool in muscle -- this pool must either self-renew or be replenished by another population. Donor SMP cells injected intramuscularly into mdx mice successfully differentiate into muscle fibers and also replenish satellite cells. This latter point is important to test in all stem cell studies, because the injected stem cells must be able to replenish the muscle stem cell pool in order to make a long-term contribution to muscle regeneration. Dr. Wagers has  found that there are  fewer SMP cells present in the muscle of aged mice and also of dystrophic (mdx) mice. In the case of aged mice, it is known that factors present in the blood of young mice can improve the regenerative capacity of the aged muscle, and Dr. Wagers plans to test this effect in dysferlin-deficient muscle as well. <br>				<br>				During the brainstorming session, an important consideration discussed was the fact that stem cell therapy has not had much success treating older animals. This could be due to an environment of the serum or muscle that does not promote stem cell regeneration or differentiation in older animals, or it could be due to the difficulty of <em>reversing</em> changes (such as fibrosis and fatty infiltrates) that are present in older diseased animals. One example  of successful reversal of damage in older individuals that was brought up during the discussion is in treatment for  retinopathies, which could provide  insights into how to reverse damage in muscle diseases.<br>				<br>				The hypothesis of a poor environment in older animals is supported by experiments presented by Dr. Wagers, showing that combining the circulatory systems of old and young mice (parabiosis) improved the regenerative capacity of muscle in the old mice. During the brainstorming session it was suggested that pregnancy might be a good natural analog of parabiosis, but it differs from parabiosis in  not allowing any mixing of blood cells. <br><br>				Another important issue that was discussed in the brainstorming session is how best to confirm that dysferlin (or another muscular dystrophy protein) is present and functioning in treated muscle. Methods such as immunofluorescence and Western blotting can be used to detect dysferlin in treated muscle, but it is also important to test for protein function, especially if autologous cells are used and modified ex vivo to express dysferlin. One good indicator of function could be to confirm that dysferlin's interactions with other proteins are preserved. <br><br>				Other points mentioned in this brainstorming session were the fact that exercise in mice increases macrophage infiltration into muscle, and that the resistance of A/J mice to atherosclerosis could be related to lack of dysferlin in their blood monocytes. <br><br><br>				<em>Note to participants:<br>				Please send us any additional points that you remember from the discussion so that we can add them to the above summary! </em></p>				<p>&nbsp;</p>                </div></td>              </tr>            </table></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td bgcolor="#FDFFC6" align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>            <td bgcolor="ffffff">&nbsp;</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td height="30" align="right" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"></td>            <td height="30" align="right" valign="middle" bgcolor="#FDFFC6"><p class="footer">                <? include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>              </p>            </td>          </tr>        </table></td>        <td background="images/bg_dot.gif" width="1"></td>      </tr>    </table>    <table width="780" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td height="4" background="images/bg_green.gif"></td>      </tr>    </table>		</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
